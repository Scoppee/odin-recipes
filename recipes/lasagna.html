    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is my mom’s beloved homemade lasagna recipe, featuring a rich, meaty tomato sauce made from scratch and a creamy, 
        cheesy filling. While traditional lasagna often uses ricotta, her version uses a flavorful mix of small-curd cottage 
        cheese and Parmesan — and I’ve yet to find a better one anywhere. It’s perfect served with a fresh green salad and some
        crusty garlic bread.

        Making homemade lasagna might look complicated, but it’s easier than you think. Don’t let the layers of bold Italian 
        flavor intimidate you — give this recipe a try today!
